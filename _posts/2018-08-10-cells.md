A short example of cell nucleus detection using clustering algorithms. The images come from [2018 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) hosted on Kaggle. The task is not trivial, because in many images nuclei have very different sizes and some of them are adjacent or even overlapping. Although the best approach for the job would be to use deep learning (some of the popular nets in this contest included [Mask-RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597), and [SegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561)), I made some [tests](https://github.com/krzysztofarendt/kaggle-dsb18/blob/master/1st_approach.ipynb) with clustering algorithms.

The procedure was divided into two stages (excluding pre-processing):

1. Detect groups of nuclei using DBSCAN and evaluate number of nuclei in each group based on the mean size of clusters.
2. Split clusters of nuclei into separate nuclei using Spectral Clustering.

It worked well on images with nuclei lumped in clusters, but similar in size. However, on images with nuclei of different size it couldn't distinguish between large nuclei and nuclei clusters (e.g. Figs. 5-6). Some outcomes below:
