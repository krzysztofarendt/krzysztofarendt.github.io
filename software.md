# ModestPy

Toolbox for parameter estimation in [Functional Mock-up Units](https://fmi-standard.org/). Interfaces with several optimization algorithms, including gradient-based methods (L-BFGS-B, SLSQP, Truncated Newton), Genetic Algorithm (in-house code), and Generalized Pattern Search (in-house code). Enables to mix the methods in arbitrary sequences.

**Project repository:** [ModestPy](https://github.com/krzysztofarendt/modest-py)

# EPQuery

EnergyPlus model editing toolbox.

**Project repository:** [EPQuery](https://github.com/krzysztofarendt/epquery)

# MShoot
