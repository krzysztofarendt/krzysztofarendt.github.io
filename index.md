Hi! I'm an Assistant Professor at the Center for Energy Informatics, University of Southern Denmark (SDU). My field of interest spans across building performance simulation, machine learning, and optimization. Currently, I teach Statistics and Data Engineering and Programming to Energy Technology students at SDU. You can find out more about my professional work (mostly related to buildings) under [Publications](/publications) and [Software](/software). In my free time, I enjoy coding and playing with different kinds of data and methods. Some of my experiences with new (to me) methods will be described on my [Blog](/blog). I work mostly in Python and R.
