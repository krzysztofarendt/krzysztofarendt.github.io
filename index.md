Hi! I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Energy Informatics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/CentreForEnergyInformatics), University of Southern Denmark (SDU). My field of interest spans across building performance simulation, machine learning, and optimization. Currently, I teach Statistics and Data Engineering and Programming to Energy Technology students at SDU. You can find out more about my professional work under [Publications](/publications) and [Software](/software). In my free time, I enjoy coding and playing with different kinds of statistical and numerical methods ([Blog](/blog)).
