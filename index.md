I'm a Data Scientist specialized in modeling, simulation, and optimization of energy systems. I work at [Warsaw Institute of Aviation](https://ilot.edu.pl/en) on predictive maintenance algorithms for [GE Transportation a Wabtec Company](https://www.getransportation.com/home). 
I have several years of research experience gained in Poland, Denmark, and USA. I was responsible for a number of university courses, including Statistics, Data Engineering and Programming, and Building Physics ([Teaching](/teaching)). You can find out more about my research and software development under [Publications](/publications) and [Software](/software).
