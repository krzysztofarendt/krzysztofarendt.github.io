I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Energy Informatics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/CentreForEnergyInformatics), University of Southern Denmark (SDU). My field of interest spans across building performance simulation (physics-based and data-driven models) and optimization. I teach (1) Statistics and (2) Data Engineering and Programming at SDU. You can find out more about my professional work under [Publications](/publications) and [Software](/software). In my free time, I enjoy coding and playing with different kinds of statistical and numerical methods ([Blog](/blog)).
