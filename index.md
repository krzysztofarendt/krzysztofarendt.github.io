I'm a data scientist with some experience in modeling, simulation, and optimization of buildings and HVAC systems, anomaly prediction in diesel engines, and audio processing algorithms (speech enhancement, sound source separation, sound detection and classification). I have several years of research experience gained in Poland, Denmark, USA, and few years of industrial experience (Wabtec, Samsung). My research interests revolve around modeling and optimization of physical systems and the trade-off between the accuracy of data-driven methods and explainability & robustness of physics-based models. You can find out more about my research and open source software at [Publications](/publications) and [Software](/software).
